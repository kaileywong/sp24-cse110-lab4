1. The bug was that when numbers a typed into the form, their values are passed to the JavaScript as strings. So when the calculateSum function adds the strings, they are just concatenated instead of an arithmetic operation.
2. I would fix it by trying to cast the string values from the HTML to numbers before they are passed to the function, using `parseFloat` (this should work for both integers and floats).
