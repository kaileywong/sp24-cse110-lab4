1. `values added: 20`

2. `final result: 20`

3. `values added: 20`

4. The code returns an error because the `result` variable is block scoped. This means it is only accessible within the if block, so trying to use its value to print outside will result in an error.

5. The code will return an error because `result` is a const and cannot be reassigned after declaration. Line 7 tries to reassign its value, which will result in an error.

6. The code will also return an error for the same reason as the previous question. `result` is a const variable, so trying to reassign its value on line 7 after it was declared at line 5 will result in an error. Also, the const variable will only be available within the scope of the if block, so it is out of scope at line 13, which would result in an error when trying to print its value.
